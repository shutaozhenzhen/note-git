# note-git README

This is a VSCode Extension to auto commit all change by git. I developed this to auto commit all changes to git when I make notes.

You need to enbale vscode.git extension, open a folder under git version control(can not be the root folder). This Extension will auto save all the changes and commit them localily.

## Features

>Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.
>For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:
>\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)
>> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.
